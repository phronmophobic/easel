**Easel** - A Pure Clojure IDE in the Spirit of Emacs

Status: Alpha. No documentation. Incomplete. Missing features.

### Differences from emacs

- clojure instead of elisp
- "everything is data" instead of "everything is text"
- modern graphics

### Goals

- IDE as a library
- Integrate anything: web, 2d graphics, 3d graphics, video, plots, widgets, games, terminal, data inspectors, debuggers, etc
- Make tools available Ã  la carte
- Small, composable widgets
- Drag and drop UI editor
- First class support for repl driven development

### Non-goals

- Backwards compatibility with emacs
- Use web technologies for UI
- Run inside a web browser
